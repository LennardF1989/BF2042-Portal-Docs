# RULE

**RULE** blocks are triggered from an in-game **EVENT**. When an **EVENT** triggers, this block will check if its **CONDITION** has been met and then execute all of the **ACTIONS**.  
  
_In the following example, the **CONDITION** is checking when a Player earns a kill, whether their team has reached the target score, Then, the **ACTIONS** execute, which in this case, is ending the gamemode for the **Player** team\'s favor._

```blockly
<block type="ruleBlock">
	<mutation isOnGoingEvent="false"></mutation>
    <field name="EVENTTYPE">OnPlayerEarnedKill</field>
    <statement name="CONDITIONS">
        <block type="conditionBlock">
            <value name="CONDITION">

                    </value>
                </block>
            </value>
        </block>
    </statement>
	<statement name="ACTIONS">

### Types of **RULE** Blocks Events

#### Ongoing

Ongoing **EVENT** types continually check if its **CONDITION** has become _True_. If so, the **ACTIONS** will be executed once. In order for the **EVENT** to execute again, the **CONDITION** must become _False_ before becoming _True_ again. Ongoing **EVENT** types exist within the  Global, Player, and Team context. Within the Player and Team contexts, payload value blocks, such as EventPlayer and EventTeam, can be used to refer to the specific Player or Team within the **EVENT**. _Note: In FFA, Ongoing Team will not execute at all._
