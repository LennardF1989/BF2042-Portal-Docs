### Notes:
1. "Displays a **Message** on the world log for 6 seconds" actually means it will be displayed as a big message for 6 seconds, then got pushed in a smaller stack above, where it will be eventually pushed away from the screen.
2. You can see all the message appearances [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/907670279675842640/908647207023026196/unknown.png).
